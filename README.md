# GAN-Image-Captioning
NLP Course Project

**Abstract: **

GANs were originally designed to generate continuous data and have become very successful in the field of Computer Vision. Following recent success, we use the Gumbel Softmax relaxation technique to overcome the non-differentiability issue when dealing with discrete data. Using this model, the generator can learn to generate realistic sentences based on feedback from the discriminator as it learns important, discriminative features for telling them apart. We also correlate the discriminator scores with human evaluation scores to understand how close their behaviours are, and propose to standardize the use of a discriminator as a evaluation metric. We focus on image captioning and show major pitfalls and workarounds by exploring the capabilities of the model in conditional and unconditional generation settings. We are the first few people who have tried to generate sentences conditioned on a given context (images) in an adversarial setting using a reinforcement learning free method.
